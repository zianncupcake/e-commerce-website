//http response codes
//setting http status code is a way for server to communicate the outcome of a client's request. clients aka web browsers interpret status code to understand result of their request and take action
// The most used response status codes:

// 200 OK

//     Standard response for successful HTTP requests. The actual response will depend on the request method used. In a GET request, the response will contain an entity corresponding to the requested resource. In a POST request, the response will contain an entity describing or containing the result of the action.

// 201 Created

//     The request has been fulfilled, resulting in the creation of a new resource.

// 301 Moved Permanently

//     This and all future requests should be directed to the given URI.

// 400 Bad Request

//     The server cannot or will not process the request due to an apparent client error (e.g., malformed request syntax, size too large, invalid request message framing, or deceptive request routing)

// 401 Unauthorized

//     Similar to 403 Forbidden, but specifically for use when authentication is required and has failed or has not yet been provided. The response must include a WWW-Authenticate header field containing a challenge applicable to the requested resource. See Basic access authentication and Digest access authentication. 401 semantically means "unauthorised", the user does not have valid authentication credentials for the target resource.

//   403 Forbidden

//     The request contained valid data and was understood by the server, but the server is refusing action. This may be due to the user not having the necessary permissions for a resource or needing an account of some sort, or attempting a prohibited action (e.g. creating a duplicate record where only one is allowed). This code is also typically used if the request provided authentication by answering the WWW-Authenticate header field challenge, but the server did not accept that authentication. The request should not be repeated.

//    404 Not Found

//     The requested resource could not be found but may be available in the future. Subsequent requests by the client are permissible.

//    413 Payload Too Large

//     The request is larger than the server is willing or able to process. Previously called "Request Entity Too Large".

//    415 Unsupported Media Type

//     The request entity has a media type which the server or resource does not support. For example, the client uploads an image as image/svg+xml, but the server requires that images use a different format.

//    500 Internal Server Error

//     A generic error message, given when an unexpected condition was encountered and no more specific message is suitable.
